 * `src/dispatch/record.ts`, which drops rather than fails on such an entry).
 *
 * Built as two plumbing calls, not one: {@link blobOidAt} (`git rev-parse <oid>:<path>`) resolves
 * the blob first, which is what supplies the clean absent signal, and `git cat-file blob <blobOid>`
 * then emits that blob's stored bytes verbatim. `git show <oid>:<path>` would have collapsed both
 * steps into one command, but at the cost of the distinct absent signal and of `show`'s
 * user-facing-output remit; `cat-file blob` is the plumbing form whose entire contract is "write
 * this object's raw content, unmodified" -- it applies no smudge/EOL filter and adds no trailing
 * newline of its own, so the bytes hash identically to the file `git checkout` of that commit would
 * produce under a `core.autocrlf`-neutral configuration.
 *
 * Returned as a string rather than a `Buffer` because `src/util/exec.ts` -- the only module allowed
 * to spawn -- decodes child stdout as UTF-8. That is exact for the text artifacts multi-loopr
 * reconciles (source files, Markdown specs, JSON), and is a deliberate, documented narrowing for a
 * genuinely binary blob, whose invalid UTF-8 sequences would decode lossily. Requesting a
 * non-blob object (e.g. a directory path, which resolves to a *tree*) throws {@link InternalError}

 * *and* deletions -- so the resulting commit is exactly "the working tree as the turn left it".
 *
 * The exclusion is applied as a second `git reset -- <dir>` pass rather than as an `:(exclude)`
 * pathspec on the `git add` itself, and that is a bug fix, not a stylistic choice.
 * `git add -A -- ':(top)' ':(exclude,top).multi-loopr'` **exits 1** whenever the excluded directory
 * also happens to be listed in the repo's own `.gitignore`: naming a path in *any* pathspec, even a
 * negative one, trips `git add`'s "the following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files"
 * check. [Observed directly against a real repo: staging was still entirely correct in every case
 * -- the excluded directory was never added -- but the non-zero exit made this wrapper throw, which
 * killed a real end-to-end run whose target repo sensibly gitignored `.multi-loopr/`. Neither
 * `-c advice.addIgnoredFile=false` nor `--ignore-errors` changes the exit code; both only suppress
 * the text.]
 *
 * `git reset -q -- <dir>` has exactly the right semantics for undoing the over-broad `add` in both
 * possible states, and was verified against both: when the directory is absent from `HEAD` its
 * entries are dropped from the index entirely (back to untracked), and when it *is* tracked in
 * `HEAD` its entries are restored to their `HEAD` state (so no spurious deletion is staged). It is
 * skipped altogether when `excludeDirs` is empty, since a bare `git reset --` with no pathspec
 * would reset the whole index.
 *
 * `message` is passed as a single `-m` argv element, never through a shell and never through a
 * file: `runProcess` spawns with `shell: false`, so no character in the message is interpretable.
 * Callers are responsible for the message's *content* being neutral (PRD §7 I4); this wrapper
 * neither composes nor inspects it.
 *
 * Throws {@link InternalError} if any step fails -- including the "nothing to commit" case, which
 * `git commit` reports as exit `1`. Callers must therefore establish that there is something to
 * commit (via {@link workingTreeChanges}) before calling this.
