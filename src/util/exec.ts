// Implements PHASE_1_SPEC.md §6.1
//
// The single sanctioned child-process wrapper. This is the ONLY module in the codebase permitted
// to import `node:child_process` -- boundary/reviewer tooling greps for it and fails any other
// file that imports this module directly (PHASE_1_SPEC.md §8 acceptance check #8).
//
// Windows note (AUTONOMOUS CRITIQUE adjustment, see the executor's handoff): npm's global install
// mechanism on Windows publishes CLI tools (including both provider CLIs this project drives) as
// `.cmd` launcher shims, not `.exe` files. Node's `child_process.spawn` cannot execute a `.cmd`/
// `.bat` file at all when `shell: false` -- it fails with `ENOENT` regardless of whether the
// command is genuinely on PATH -- which is a real, OS-level limitation, not a bug in this file
// [observed locally: `spawn("claude", ["--version"], { shell: false })` -> `ENOENT`, while `where
// claude` resolves it to `...\npm\claude.cmd`]. `shell: false` for the primary spawn stays exactly
// as specified (arguments are never handed to a shell for metacharacter interpretation). The
// narrow fallback below only engages when that primary spawn fails with `ENOENT` on `win32`, and
// relaunches through `cmd.exe /d /s /v:OFF /c` -- so the fallback lets cmd.exe do its own
// PATH+PATHEXT resolution (finding the `.cmd` shim, exactly as a human typing the same command at
// a prompt would) without reintroducing shell-injection risk through argument content.
//
// Why the fallback builds the command line itself (bug fix; see `buildWindowsCmdRelaunch`): the
// fallback originally passed `["/d", "/s", "/c", command, ...args]` as a normal argv array with
// `shell: false`, and simply *refused* to engage whenever any argument contained one of
// `& | < > ^ % " \r \n`. Both halves of that were wrong for arguments containing `"`:
//
//   * Node/libuv quote an argv array using the MSVCRT/`CommandLineToArgvW` convention, in which an
//     embedded quote is escaped as `\"`. cmd.exe has never understood `\"` -- it is a *different*
//     grammar, and it tracks quote state by counting raw `"` characters. Handing a `\"`-escaped
//     line to `cmd /c` therefore desynchronises cmd's quote parity, which is precisely the
//     dialect mismatch behind CVE-2024-27980 / CVE-2024-24576 ("BatBadBut").
//   * The blanket refusal meant the `codex` adapter -- whose `-c key="value"` config overrides
//     unavoidably contain literal `"` (Codex's own documented override syntax) -- could never be
//     relaunched at all, so every real Codex turn failed with `ENOENT` on Windows while
//     `doctor --providers` still reported it healthy (its preflight probes use unquoted args).
//
// The fix builds the full cmd.exe command line as one correctly-escaped string and spawns it with
// `windowsVerbatimArguments: true`, bypassing libuv's argv quoting entirely. See
// `quoteForWindowsCommandLine` for the escaping rule and `CMD_IRREDUCIBLY_UNSAFE_CHARS` for the
// (now much narrower, but still genuinely fail-safe) set of characters the fallback still refuses.
//
// exitCode:null caveat on the fallback path (disclosed in Step 12's adversarial review, approved
// commit e389620): PHASE_1_SPEC.md §6.1's contract that a spawn error resolves with
// `exitCode: null` describes the non-Windows-fallback path. When the cmd.exe relaunch above
// engages and the underlying command genuinely isn't found by cmd.exe's own PATH+PATHEXT
// resolution either, the result comes from cmd.exe's own `close` event, not from a second spawn
// error -- so `exitCode` is cmd.exe's real (non-null) exit code, observed on this machine as `1`.
// That is the same code some legitimate business-logic outcomes already use elsewhere in this
// codebase (e.g. `codex login status` returning `1` for "not logged in"), and there is no
// reliable, locale-independent numeric signal to tell the two apart; parsing cmd.exe's own
// (potentially localized) stderr text to disambiguate would be exactly the non-deterministic
// heuristic the I2 invariant (PRD §7) forbids, so this file does not attempt it. This is a
// documented, deliberate, narrower exception to §6.1 on Windows, not an oversight. Any caller
// that needs a reliable "is this CLI even installed" signal on Windows must not rely on
// `exitCode === null` specifically -- treat any non-zero exit code as the failure signal, which
// every current caller already does.

/**
 * The characters that genuinely cannot be made safe inside a `cmd.exe /c` command line, and so are

 * much narrower than the blanket `[&|<>^%"\r\n]` blocklist it replaces -- `& | < > ^` and `"` are
 * now *correctly handled* by {@link quoteForWindowsCommandLine} instead of being rejected.
 *
 * Each remaining character was verified empirically on Windows 11 (26200) by round-tripping it
 * through a real `%*`-forwarding `.cmd` shim, which is the exact shape of the npm launcher shims
 * this fallback exists to reach:
 *
 *   * `%` -- cmd.exe performs `%VAR%` expansion *before* the quote/caret processing phase, so it
 *     happens even inside a fully quoted token and cannot be suppressed by any quoting this
 *     function can emit [observed: `pct-%PATH%-end` arrived as `pct-C:\Users\hp\bin;...-end`].
 *     Rust's std works around this with a `%%cd:~,%` no-op-substring trick that depends on command
 *     extensions being enabled; this file refuses instead, which is strictly safer and needs no
 *     assumption about the inherited cmd.exe configuration.
 *   * `\r` / `\n` -- terminate or truncate the command line [observed: `lf-\n-end` arrived as
 *     `lf-`, `cr-\r-end` arrived as `cr--end`], so a trailing fragment could become a *second*
 *     command. This matches the same refusal in Rust std's own `make_bat_command_line`.
 *   * `\0` -- cannot appear in a Win32 command line at all.
 *
 * Note that `!` is *not* in this set: delayed expansion (`!VAR!`) is what would make it dangerous,
 * and the relaunch passes `/v:OFF` explicitly to guarantee it is disabled regardless of the
 * machine's `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\DelayedExpansion` registry setting
 * [verified: `bang-!PATH!-end` round-trips verbatim].

 * Quotes one token for a Windows command line that will be parsed **twice**: first by cmd.exe's own

 * parser (with, in the `.cmd`-shim case this fallback exists for, cmd.exe's `%*` raw-tail

 *
 * The rule -- taken from Rust std's `append_bat_arg`, the implementation hardened in response to
 * CVE-2024-24576, and cross-checked against Node's `child_process` docs on `windowsVerbatimArguments`:
 *
 *   1. Wrap the whole token in `"` unconditionally. Everything inside a cmd.exe quoted region is
 *      inert, which is what neutralises `& | < > ^ ( )` without needing caret escapes at all.
 *   2. Escape an embedded `"` by **doubling** it (`""`), not as `\"`. Both parsers accept `""` as a
 *      literal quote, and -- critically -- doubling keeps cmd.exe's raw `"` count even, so the
 *      token never falls out of quoted context. `\"` is understood by the argv parser but *not* by
 *      cmd.exe, and using it here is the actual root cause of the bug this replaces.
 *   3. Double any run of backslashes that immediately precedes a `"` (embedded or the closing one),
 *      per the documented `CommandLineToArgvW` rule that `2n` backslashes before a quote mean `n`
 *      literal backslashes. Backslashes elsewhere are literal and are left alone, so ordinary
 *      Windows paths (`C:\Users\hp\multi-loopr`) pass through untouched.
 *
 * Verified by round-tripping every case in `exec.test.ts` through both a real `%*`-forwarding
 * `.cmd` shim and a directly-spawned `.exe`, in both cases recovering the argv byte-for-byte.
