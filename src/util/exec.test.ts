// Implements PHASE_1_SPEC.md §1.6 / §6.1 -- exec.test.ts
//
// PHASE_1_SPEC.md's own test-file table (§1.6) does not list a dedicated exec.test.ts, and
// runProcess() is already exercised indirectly by every other suite (git.ts, preflight.ts,
// main.test.ts's real child-process invocations of `node`, `claude`, and `codex`). This file adds
// *direct*, black-box coverage of runProcess()'s own documented contract (§6.1), added by the
// Phase 1 reviewer specifically to close a gap: the Windows `.cmd`/`.bat`-shim relaunch fallback
// described in this module's own file-level comment (see exec.ts) had no dedicated test anywhere,
// despite being a real, unspecified-in-§6.1 behavioural addition with a security-relevant
// rationale (it exists precisely because `shell: false` -- which §6.1 calls mandatory -- cannot
// execute a `.cmd` launcher at all on Windows). This file pins down, with real spawns, both:
// (a) the contract §6.1 states outright (never rejects; a spawn error looks like a resolved
//     failure, not a thrown exception; a genuine ENOENT with shell-unsafe argument content is
//     never silently relaunched), and
// (b) the *actual observed* behaviour of the relaunch path on this platform for a safe-argument,
//     truly nonexistent command -- which is NOT the literal `exitCode: null` §6.1 step 6
//     describes, because cmd.exe itself resolves the sub-command lookup and reports its own exit
//     code (observed: `1`) rather than the parent spawn call ENOENT-ing. This is a genuine,
//     verified deviation from §6.1's literal text, flagged in the Phase 1 review rather than
//     silently left uncovered. It does not currently break any Phase 1 caller because every
//     consumer of RawInvocationResult in this codebase (see preflight.ts's parse* functions) keys
//     on `exitCode !== 0`, never on `exitCode === null` specifically -- but the distinction the
//     type signature (`exitCode: number | null`) was designed to carry is real, and a future
//     phase must not assume `null` is the only way "the command was not found" surfaces on
//     Windows.

/**
 * Creates a throwaway directory containing an npm-cmd-shim-shaped `mlfakecli.cmd` that forwards the
 * raw command tail via `%*` to a Node script echoing its own argv as JSON, and prepends that
 * directory to `PATH`.
 *
 * The shim shape matters: `%*` means the command line is re-parsed by cmd.exe a *second* time
 * before the argv parser ever sees it, which is the exact double-parse that makes naive `\"`
 * escaping exploitable (CVE-2024-24576 "BatBadBut"). A bare, extensionless command name is used
 * because that is what reproduces the real failure -- `CreateProcess` only appends `.exe`, never
 * the full `PATHEXT`, so Node's `shell: false` spawn of `mlfakecli` fails `ENOENT` exactly as it
 * does for the real `codex`, which is what arms the fallback under test. (A *full path* to a
 * `.cmd` would fail `EINVAL` instead, since Node refuses those outright post-CVE-2024-27980, and
 * would therefore not exercise this path at all.)
