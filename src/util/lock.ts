//
// The exclusive on-disk run lock. V1's handoff model is strictly sequential, one agent active at
// a time (PRD §3 item 8); this primitive enforces that rather than assuming it. Acquisition uses
// `fs.open(path, "wx")`, an atomic filesystem primitive -- an `existsSync` check followed by a
// write would be a check-then-act race and is forbidden.
//
// Reclaiming a stale lock is the one operation here that can BREAK the invariant rather than
// enforce it, so every reclaim decision is biased toward refusing: see `reclaimIfStaleOrThrow` and
// `processLivenessVerdict` for why "the liveness probe failed" and "the lock was minted on another
// host" are both treated as held, never as stale.

/**
 * Inspects the existing lock at `lockPath` (already known to exist via a prior `EEXIST`) and
 * decides whether it may be reclaimed. Throws {@link LockHeldError} when the lock must be left
 * alone; otherwise unlinks it (stale or corrupt) so the caller can retry the create exactly once.
 *
 * Reclaiming means unlinking a file another process may still be relying on, so the decision is
 * deliberately asymmetric: it unlinks only on *positive* evidence that the holder is gone. Three
 * distinct refusals, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Cross-host.** A pid is only meaningful on the machine that minted it. If `info.host` is not
 *    this machine's `hostname()` -- which happens whenever `.multi-loopr` lives on a shared or
 *    network filesystem -- there is nothing local to probe, and probing anyway would almost always
 *    report "not found" and steal a lock held by a live process on the other host. Refuse without
 *    probing, and name both hosts so an operator can actually diagnose it.
 * 2. **Alive.** The usual case: the holder's pid answers the probe.
 * 3. **Indeterminate.** The probe failed for a reason that is neither "no such process" nor
 *    "exists but not yours" (see {@link processLivenessVerdict}). A failed probe is not evidence of
 *    death, so it must never license a reclaim.
 *
 * `killFn` is a test seam only, threaded to {@link processLivenessVerdict}; it defaults to the real
 * `process.kill`, so `acquireRunLock`'s call site -- which never passes it -- is byte-identical to
 * before this parameter existed. Exported for the same reason: the indeterminate branch is
 * unreachable from `acquireRunLock`'s fixed two-argument public signature, which this hardening
 * fix is not permitted to change.
