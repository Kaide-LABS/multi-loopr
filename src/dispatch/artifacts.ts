// the run (`baby_prd.md`, `context.md`, the phase spec), and that the reviewer turn genuinely
// produced the run's next loopr artifact rather than merely re-declaring a stale, untouched file.
// Placed in `src/dispatch/` rather than `src/verify/` because, unlike Phase 1's general-purpose
// repo verifiers, these two functions are specific to the dispatch loop's own `RunConfig`-derived
// expectations -- the same reason `record.ts`'s `reconcileHandoffRecord()` lives here too.
