// Implements PHASE_3_SPEC.md §6.3 -- [DET, DECISION Phase 3, PRD §7 I2]
//
// The central mechanism that keeps `HandoffRecord`'s correctness-critical fields out of the
// "agent's say-so" path I2 forbids, while still letting the agent be the source of the fields only
// it can know (the summary text, which paths it touched). A "compare and reject on mismatch"
// design was considered and rejected: it would require the agent's prompt instructions to get git
// plumbing and hashing exactly right merely to avoid a spurious rejection, adding fragility with
// no security benefit -- replacing outright is simpler, strictly more robust to an agent's
// git-plumbing mistakes, and is what §6.2 item 4 already tells the agent to expect.
//
// `artifacts_read` and `artifacts_written` are both replaced with ground truth, but with ground
// truth taken at **two different points in time**, and that asymmetry is load-bearing rather than an
// inconsistency:
//
//   * `artifacts_written` -- reconciled against the **working tree as the turn left it**
//     (`reconcileWrittenFileRefs`). "What this turn produced" is by definition the final content on
//     disk once the turn is over, so end-of-turn disk is the only correct reference point.
//   * `artifacts_read` -- reconciled against **`ground.headBefore`**, the commit the *prior* turn
//     produced, i.e. the repository exactly as this turn found it (`reconcileReadFileRefs`). A read
//     necessarily happened before the reading turn's own edits, so end-of-turn disk is the wrong
//     clock for it.
//
// [Live-run bug, fixed here.] Both used to be reconciled from end-of-turn disk. That silently broke
// `checkC5ArtifactAttestation` (`src/verify/continuity.ts`, correct and untouched), which proves a
// turn genuinely read what the prior turn wrote by comparing `next.artifacts_read[p].sha256`
// against `prev.artifacts_written[p].sha256`. Whenever a turn legitimately *modified* a file it had
// been handed -- reading the prior turn's test file and adding a case to it, entirely normal
// spec-following work -- the disk-based hash captured at end-of-turn was the hash of the turn's own
// edit, never of the version it read, so C5 reported a "stale read" indistinguishable from having
// never read the file at all. Observed live: turn 0 wrote `wordcount.mjs` and `wordcount.test.mjs`;
// turn 1 demonstrably read both, appended a test case to `wordcount.test.mjs`, and committed --
// the untouched file attested cleanly, the modified one failed C5. This was structural, not an
// agent-behaviour gap: no wording in any prompt can make a turn satisfy a check that compares the
// wrong point in time, and the only way to pass was to never modify a handed-over file. The overall
// philosophy is unchanged -- ground truth still fully replaces the agent's claims, and the agent's
// own hashes are still discarded outright; only *which* ground truth `artifacts_read` is replaced
// with was wrong.

 * end-of-turn disk. See the file header for why the two collections use different reference points;
 * in short, a read can only ever have been of the repository as this turn found it, and hashing
 * end-of-turn disk instead made `C5_ARTIFACT_ATTESTATION` fail for every turn that legitimately
 * modified a file the prior turn handed it.
 *
 * Hashing goes through `sha256String` on the blob's content, deliberately the same SHA-256 utility
 * `sha256File` uses for disk bytes, so a file that is byte-identical at `headBefore` and on disk
 * hashes identically by both routes -- which is what keeps `assertLooprArtifactsReferenced()`'s
 * static loopr artifacts (`baby_prd.md`, `context.md`, the phase spec, none of them modified
 * mid-run) reconciling exactly as before.
 *
 * Drop-don't-fail semantics are preserved exactly, via `blobContentAt`'s `null`-on-absent return:
 * an entry whose path did not exist at `headBefore` is dropped, mirroring the ENOENT drop above.
 * That is the right disposition and not merely a symmetry: a path absent at turn-start is one the
 * agent could not possibly have read -- typically one it is about to create itself and
 * over-reported -- which is precisely the over-report case the drop behaviour already existed for.
 * (Corollary for operators: the run's loopr artifacts must be *committed* at the run's starting
 * HEAD, not left uncommitted in the working tree, or they cannot be attested as read.)
 *
 * Known, bounded edge case -- `core.autocrlf`. `artifacts_read` now hashes *stored* bytes while
 * `artifacts_written` hashes *working-tree* bytes, and git only guarantees those are the same bytes
 * when no EOL filter is active. Under `core.autocrlf=true` (the Git-for-Windows installer default,
 * and set at *system* level on a stock Windows install) a file whose working-tree copy uses CRLF is
 * stored as LF, so the two routes would disagree for that file and C5 would see a spurious stale
 * read. It does not bite the real path: both provider CLIs write LF, so an agent-authored artifact
 * -- the only kind `artifacts_written` ever names -- is LF on disk and LF in the object store, and
 * hashes identically either way. [Verified empirically on this machine with
 * `core.autocrlf=true`: an LF-authored file's disk and blob SHA-256 are equal; a deliberately
 * CRLF-authored one's are not.] Applying git's checkout-side filters instead (`git cat-file
 * --filters`) was considered and rejected: it would fix the CRLF-on-disk case by breaking the
 * far more common LF-on-disk one, since under `autocrlf=true` git's notion of the working-tree form
 * is CRLF whether or not the file on disk actually uses it.
