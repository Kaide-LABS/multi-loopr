 * really commit the turn's work, the advisory-only nature of agent-authored `repo`/`spec_ref`, the
 * honest-halt requirement, and (Phase 4, new) the instruction to genuinely read and record all
 * three of loopr's own artifacts for this build -- `baby_prd.md`, `context.md`, *and* the phase spec
 * itself -- in `artifacts_read`. Prose is not fixed verbatim by the spec -- what is
 * load-bearing is that each of the eight mandatory-content items appears as a literal substring
 * (PHASE_3_SPEC.md §6.2 items 1-6, PHASE_4_SPEC.md §6.2 items 7-8, all tested individually); item
 * 2's eighteen field names now appear as an annotated list rather than a bare comma-joined one,
 * which satisfies the same substring requirement while removing the value-shape ambiguity that
 * broke a live dispatch. Shared verbatim by {@link buildExecutorPrompt} and
 * {@link buildReviewerPrompt}, so the commit requirement below binds both roles from one place.
 *
 * [DECISION] The commit requirement is stated explicitly, and item 4's "advisory only" sentence is
 * scoped explicitly to *field values*, because the pair was genuinely ambiguous in live dispatch: a
 * real Claude Code executor turn did the phase's actual work (wrote the module, wrote its tests,
 * ran them green) and reported `status: "completed"` without ever running `git add`/`git commit` --
 * a plausible reading of "do not spend turn budget trying to get git plumbing exactly right" is
 * "git is optional here". Ground-truth reconciliation (`src/dispatch/record.ts`) correctly saw
 * `head_before === head_after`, `commits: []`, and refused the turn on R3 (`src/domain/relay.ts`).
 * The advisory note is true of the *values* the agent self-reports for `repo`/`spec_ref`; it was
 * never permission to skip the underlying action, so the two ideas are now separated and each
 * bounded. The neutral-commit-message clause rides along deliberately: the turn is now told to
 * commit, and an attribution trailer in that commit is a hard `BoundaryViolationError`
 * (`src/verify/commits.ts`, PRD §7 I4) that fails the run with no retry -- strictly worse than the
 * retryable R3 refusal it would replace -- so the requirement and its constraint are stated
 * together.
 *
 * [DECISION] The commit requirement is followed by one explicitly narrow exception, because the
 * requirement as first written was unsatisfiable for one real provider on one real platform: Codex
 * CLI runs under `--sandbox workspace-write` unconditionally (`CodexCliAdapter.buildInvocation()`,
 * PRD §9 FM7), and on Windows that sandbox denies writes to `.git/` outright -- verified directly
 * against a real repo, where every `git` write returned `fatal: Unable to create
 * '<repo>/.git/index.lock': Permission denied`. An agent told only "you must commit" and unable to
 * comply has no honest move left but `status: "blocked"`, which would fail turns whose actual work
 * was finished. `runTurn()` step 5.5 (`src/dispatch/turn.ts`) now commits such leftovers itself, so
 * the prompt states the fallback exists. It is worded as *inability*, not permission: the exception
 * names the concrete failure (git refuses with a permission error), requires attempting the commit
 * first, and says outright that it does not apply when git works. That deliberate narrowness is a
 * direct response to the original bug -- a broadly-worded "you don't strictly have to commit" is
 * exactly the ambiguity that caused a live turn to skip committing entirely, and softening the rule
 * generally to unblock one sandbox would reintroduce it.
 *
 * [DECISION] The phase-spec sentence carries the same explicit "and record it in artifacts_read"
 * clause as the `baby_prd.md`/`context.md` sentences, because its absence was genuinely
 * load-bearing in live dispatch: a real Claude Code executor turn read and used all three artifacts
 * (its `work_done` narrative and the code it wrote both reflect having read the spec), but its
 * `artifacts_read` listed only `baby_prd.md` and `context.md` -- the two artifacts whose sentences
 * asked for the recording -- and `assertLooprArtifactsReferenced()` (`src/dispatch/artifacts.ts`,
 * PRD §2 AC3) correctly refused the turn on the missing `spec_path`. An instruction that says only
 * "read X and do the work" is a complete, self-consistent instruction on its own terms; nothing in
 * it implies a bookkeeping obligation that the two neighbouring sentences state outright. All three
 * required artifacts are now asked for identically, so the prompt's coverage matches exactly what
 * `assertLooprArtifactsReferenced()` enforces. Implements PHASE_3_SPEC.md §6.2, PHASE_4_SPEC.md
 * §6.2.
